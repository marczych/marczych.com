# Global Game Jam

[Global Game Jam] is an event where teams from all over the globe create games according to a theme from start to finish in 48 hours.
It is a lot of fun to take a weekend and work with different people on a very unique project.
I also got the chance to do nearly all of the music for these games which was a blast.
Here are the four games that I've developed:

_[Planes on a Snake]_ is a game whose plot is a play on the movie Snakes on a Plane.
The player controls Jamuel L. Sackson by firing at enemy plans before they crash into the snake-covered earth.
The game is written in Lua with [LOVE].

In _[Heart Healer Extreme]_, the player controls an enthusiastic man tasked with keeping everybody in the immedate vicinity happy.
He acquires new heart healing weapons with various cooldowns, effectivenesses, and ranges.
The game is written in Lua with [LOVE].

[Peggle Damacy] is a mashup of [Peggle] and [Katamari Damacy].
The goal is to collect all of the pegs on the board but only the ones in the player's available spectrum can be collected.
Collecting pegs expands the available spectrum and increases the size of the fired ball.
The game is written in Lua with [LOVE].

[Business Team] came to life when [Business Time] and [SpaceTeam] came together.
This is a web based cooperative game that involves telling your teammates to complete certain tasks before the time runs out.
This was written using [Node.js] and [socket.io].
