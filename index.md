I'm Marc, a software engineer currently living in San Luis Obispo, California.
I work at iFixit which is a company dedicated to teaching everybody how to fix everything.
I work on the web application that powers [iFixit] and [Dozuki], the enterprise-focused Software as a Service technical documentation platform.
I do a variety of things including server administration, backend features, and Android development.

I graduated from [Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo][Cal Poly] in 2013 with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science via the Blended 4+1 program.
For [my thesis], I investigated caching strategies for large-scale websites, implemented the best one for a particular production website, and ran an experiment to determine how much better it performed than the existing implementation.

In my free time I enjoy programming, playing (and recording) music, and road biking.
