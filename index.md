I'm Marc, a Software Engineer living in the Bay Area <a href="/files/resume.pdf">[resume]</a>.
I currently work at [Zoox], an autonomous vehicle startup.
I primarily work on continuous integration, our monolithic build system, and web frontends for internal tools.
[(We're hiring!)][zoox jobs]

I previously worked at [iFixit], a company dedicated to teaching everybody how to fix everything.
I developed the web application that powers iFixit and [Dozuki], the enterprise-focused Software as a Service technical documentation platform.
I worked on a variety of things including server administration, backend features, and Android development.

I graduated from [Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo][Cal Poly] in 2013 with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science through the Blended 4+1 program.
For [my thesis], I investigated caching strategies, implemented generational caching for iFixit, and ran an experiment to determine how much better it performed than the existing implementation.

In my free time I enjoy programming, playing (and recording) music, cooking, and road biking.
