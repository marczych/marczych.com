I'm Marc, a Software Engineer living in San Luis Obispo, California.
I work at [iFixit], a company dedicated to teaching everybody how to fix everything.
I'm a developer for the web application that powers iFixit and [Dozuki], the enterprise-focused Software as a Service technical documentation platform.
I do a variety of things including server administration, backend features, and Android development.

I graduated from [Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo][Cal Poly] in 2013 with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science through the Blended 4+1 program.
For [my thesis], I investigated caching strategies, implemented generational caching for iFixit, and ran an experiment to determine how much better it performed than the existing implementation.

In my free time I enjoy programming, playing (and recording) music, and road biking.
